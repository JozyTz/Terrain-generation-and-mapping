9/3/22
Created map printing/color methods
Created map border method
Created map entrances methods
Started work on biome seeding
Reworked other methods to reduce variables/make more generalized functions
Created helper method to get random number betweeen two bounds

9/4/22
Completed biome generation
Fleshed out the colors fully so everything looks nice
Started path generation

9/5/22
Fixed biome generation, tweaked values to make it look nicer
Worked on path generation methods, shortest cardinal distance from starting point to a target
Started work on adding buildings
Started work onn adding random objects

9/6/22
Debug floatingpoint errors and other various coredump issues
Completed path generation methods
fixed biome generation (..again)
Completed adding buildings methods

9/7/22
Fix buildings methods edgee cases so user doesn't walk through obstacles
fix path generation (..again)
Documentation
Testing

===============================================================

9/9/22
Refactor map_generator to make a struct for the GameMap
Update methods to use this struct and use pointers

9/11/22
Create WorldMap struct to hold an array of GameMaps, as well as the coordinates
Update existing methods to use pointers from the WorldMap to the GameMap

9/12/22
Created the map_navigation file and update other files to be included in it
created an initWorld method to set the WorldMap data to NULL, able to print the center map

9/13/22
Created the moveMaps methods and tweaked the entrance methods to prevent entrances from being made on the world border
Got movemaps working, able to genereate new maps, old maps show in same locations, and entrances line up

9/14/22
Fixed the createPaths methods to accomadate a possible lack of entrance (borders)
Added a building probability functionality
Added the quit/delete world functionality
Bugfixing segmentation faults (mostly out of bound stuff)
Edge testing, bugfixing

===============================================================

9/20/22
Added terrain enums
added structs for players, mobs, and distancemaps

9/23/22
updated methods for terrain enums
pulled heap code to project

9/24/22
wrote base dijkstras method into pathfinder file
fixed headers/declaration bugs

9/25/22
added hiker/rival terrain weighting
added printout for distance maps iinto dijkstras
added more enum types, mountain, forest, entrance

9/26/22
added a distance map key to the running game - 'd'
added random playerchar location on first map, player declared in WorldMap so its global
updated the paths methods to account for new ENTRANCE terrain type

9/27/22
Fixed memory leaks/bugs via valgrind
edge/force testing
updated print methods

9/28/22
Wrote makefile
updated readme
Cleaned up duplicate/unneeded code a little bit
documented new code
